# hello-world

To people interested in automated mapping by using remote sensing imagery.

The repository 'buildenh_jh' is a tool for automated mapping.
If you are interested to try the tool or to contribute with ideas, resources and discussions please inform me.

The repository 'EduServ17Mat' is a learning tool. It contains programs and data for checking and enhancement of land cover maps. These are additions to the book "Automated extraction of topographic map data from remotely sensed imagery by classification and cartographic enhancement".
